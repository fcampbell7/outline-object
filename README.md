# outline-object
Python program using OpenCV library to outline object of a specific colour in images. 

Repository includes a few sample images which work well currently.

Requires OpenCV and numpy libraries.


# Future Changes and known issues

- Error handling
  - Check if pathway is valid
  - Check inputted colour is a valid string and is a valid colour
- Cooler colours such as green, blue and purple don't work very well currently
  - Will need to tweak colour balance for those to pick up properly
